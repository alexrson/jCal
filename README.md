jCal - The French Republican Calendar App
====

This is an app which gives the user the current date in the French Republican Calendar, also known as the Jacobin Calendar, also known as the French Revolutionary Calendar.

The French Republican Calendar was used officially from 1793 through the end of 1805. The calendar starts with the beginning of the Republican Era and the abolition of the Bourbon monarchy on September 22nd 1792.

I implemented it here as a way to learn the basics of Swift and because there is currently no free app doing this in the Apple App store (There is one in Google Play).
