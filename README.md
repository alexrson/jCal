This is an app which gives the user the current date in the French Republican Calendar, also known as the Jacobin Calendar, also known as the French Revolutionary Calendar, known in French as la calendrier révolutionnaire français.

The French Republican Calendar was used officially from 1793 through the end of 1805. The calendar starts with the beginning of the Republican Era and the abolition of the monarchy on September 22nd 1792. It was created by a commission headed by Gilbert Romme. Along with the adoption of the Republican calendar the Jacobins also instituted a number of other reforms with the goals of eliminating traces of Ancien Régime influence and adopting decimal unit schemes. These reforms include the metric system, decimal time and decimal currency.  Over the years of French Republic and into the Napoleonic Era the more ridiculous of the calendar reforms were eliminated partly as part of a rapprochement with the Vatican who strongly favored the seven day week. Napoleon abolished the calendar wholesale in 1805. The metric system of units and decimal currency, however, are alive and well.

I implemented it here as a way to learn the basics of iOS development in Swift and because there is currently no free app doing this in the Apple App store (There is one in Google Play).
